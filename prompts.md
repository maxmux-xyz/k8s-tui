Look at k8s-pod-manager-go-tui.md this is what we want to implement.
Look at ./docs to see what we've done for now.

Make a new plan to continue building our new TUI. 
From the plan isolate what would be a next good self contained task.
We want to make methodical incremental progress, not so sloppy job all at once.
Make sure to write tests in the process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at ./docs/docs/plans and pick up the next plan that is ready to be worked on andf has not been implemented yet.
Implement the plan. When done, write implementation notes to docs/implemented.
And append "done" to the plan file name.

Then commit the changes to the repository.
`git add . && git commit -m "Implement plan X"`

Then add an md file in ./docs/human_test ()
- list some new things we should implement that the human should test.
- human on call will test those things and come back with feedback if anything is not working as expected.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at ./docs to see what we've done for now.
Give me directions, as a user, on the following:
- What functionalities are implemented?
- How can i test the current implementation?
