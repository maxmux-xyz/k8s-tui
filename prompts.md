Look at k8s-pod-manager-go-tui.md this is what we want to implement.
Look at ./docs to see what we've done for now.

Make a new plan to continue building our new TUI. 
From the plan isolate what would be a next good self contained task.
We want to make methodical incremental progress, not so sloppy job all at once.
Make sure to write tests in the process.

Look at ./docs to see what we've done for now.
Give me directions, as a user, on the following:
- What functionalities are implemented?
- How can i test the current implementation?
