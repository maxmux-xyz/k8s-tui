look at k8s-pod-manager-go-tui.md this is what we want to implement.
look at ./docs to see what we've done for now.

Make a new plan to start building our new TUI. 
From the plan isolate what would be a next good self contained task.
We want to make methodical incremental progress, not so sloppy job all at once.
Make sure to write tests in the process.
