# Human Test Checklist: File Browser

**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Feature:** File Browser (Phase 6)

## Prerequisites

- Running Kubernetes cluster with pods
- Pod must have containers with accessible filesystem

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Navigation

- [ ] Select a pod in the pod list
- [ ] Press 'f' to open file browser
- [ ] Verify file browser shows root directory (/)
- [ ] Verify directory entries show "D " prefix
- [ ] Verify file entries show "F " prefix
- [ ] Verify symlinks show "L " prefix with arrow to target

### 2. Directory Navigation

- [ ] Use j/k to move selection up/down
- [ ] Press Enter on a directory to navigate into it
- [ ] Verify path in header updates correctly
- [ ] Press Backspace to go back to parent directory
- [ ] Verify path history works (can go back multiple levels)
- [ ] Navigate to ".." entry - should go to parent

### 3. File Viewing

- [ ] Navigate to a text file (e.g., /etc/passwd)
- [ ] Press Enter to view file contents
- [ ] Verify file content appears in scrollable viewport
- [ ] Use j/k to scroll through file content
- [ ] Use g/G to go to top/bottom of file
- [ ] Press Backspace or Esc to return to directory listing

### 4. Edge Cases

- [ ] Try to navigate to a non-existent directory (should show error)
- [ ] Try to read a file without permissions (should show error)
- [ ] Navigate to an empty directory (should show "(empty directory)")
- [ ] View a large file (should be truncated at 100KB)
- [ ] Press 'f' when no pods are available (should do nothing)

### 5. UI/UX

- [ ] Verify size column shows human-readable sizes (K/M/G)
- [ ] Verify permissions column shows correctly
- [ ] Verify long filenames are truncated with "..."
- [ ] Verify selection cursor (">") is visible
- [ ] Verify status bar shows item count and current position
- [ ] Press Esc from file browser to return to pod list

### 6. Error Handling

- [ ] Disconnect from cluster while browsing (should show error)
- [ ] Select a pod that gets terminated (should show error)
- [ ] Try to read a binary file (should display raw content, may look garbled)

## Known Limitations

- File size limit of 100KB for preview
- No syntax highlighting
- No file download capability
- Binary files displayed as raw bytes

## Notes for Tester

- Test with pods that have different container images (alpine, ubuntu, busybox)
- Some containers may not have common directories like /etc
- Check behavior with symlinks that point to non-existent targets
